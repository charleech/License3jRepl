# License3jRepl
Read Eval Print Loop application for License3j library to manage licenses and keys.

This application can be used to create key pairs, create licenses and to sign licenses. The typical workflow is to
create a key pair that will be used to sign and verify licenses. The private key should be stored in some secure place,
like a `.key` directory in your home directory on your machine, or on a USB drive stored in a bank vault. It all
depends on your security needs.

The public key, as it is public can be advertised, but most likely you will embed it into the the code of your
application.

# Start the application

To start the application you should issue the command:

```
java -cp License3jrepl-3.1.0.jar;license3j-3.1.0.jar;repl-1.0.1.jar javax0.license3jrepl.App
```

The list of the JAR files following the command line parameter `-cp` should include the core License3j library,
the License3j Repl application and the Repl framework. The versions in the sample line above are one of the
first versions. It is recommended to use the latest released versions. The License3j and License3Repl libraries
are released with matching version numbers.

The names of the files should include the path to the file using the operating system native notation. The
path can be relative to the current working directory or can be absolute. In the example above the JAR files are 
all in the current working directory.

The list of libraries is separated using `;` on Windows and `:` on Linux and on other Unix operating system.
The last argument `javax0.license3jrepl.App` is the name of the class that contains the `public static main()`
method that initializes the REPL application and starts it up.

If the command line is correct and the libraries can be found by the Java environment then you will see the

```
L3j> $
```

prompt. The first thing you can try is to ask for help.

```
L3j> $ help

# How to issue commands in the application

You can issue commands in the application interactively typing commands after the prompt. The format of the
different commands are described in the help text.

## Exiting the program

Just type `exit`. If you get the warning that

```
[WARNING] There is unsaved state in the application. Use 'exit confirm=yes'
```

then there is a license in the memory that was loaded, modified and not saved yet. If you are sure you want to lose the
modifications that you made you should follow the suggestion of the warning text and use `exit confirm=yes`. That
will force the exit to the operating system.

You can also press Control-C or terminate the Java process. The application does not keep any file open and thus
there is no danger to render anything unstable. You may, however, loose some modification from the license you
manipulated in the memory just like if you typed `exit confirm=yes`.

## Operating System Commands

You can execute OS commands if you type `!` at the start of the line. That way you can see what is in a directory,
you can type/cat the content of a file to the screen wthout leawing the REPL application.
